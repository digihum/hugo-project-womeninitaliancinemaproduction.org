        How can you use this website?

        This website is run by the University of Warwick. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.

        On this website, you should be able to:

        change colours, contrast levels and fonts zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
        navigate the website using just a keyboard, you can use links to skip over the navigation and get to content quicker navigate the website using speech recognition software listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) view the website on a tablet or mobile device in either orientation. This website is designed for a broad public audience, so we aim to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        If you have a disability, then AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use.

        We support our staff and students in their use of assistive software that you may find helpful.

        How accessible is this website?

        We know some pages of this website aren't fully accessible:

        For very small devices, the website will work but you may experience some minor text-overlaps in some pages (usually when viewed in portrait). We tested using iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Pro 7, Kindle Fire and small devices like Galaxy S8.
        Interactivity such as inter-linked text, keyword searches, selection from drop-down menu listings, and timeline are frequently used to provide rich visual interfaces to engage with media and data in the field of digital humanities. We design all of our sites to have text-based alternative navigation routes for access to and displays of the content, but some presentations of that content may not function as intended.
        Some web pages may have colour or contrast issues. We have given our content creators a checklist to follow, to avoid creating these issues in future.

        Technical information about this website's accessibility

        The University of Warwick is committed to making this website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

        This service is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

        Non-accessible content

        We are working to meet the compliance as specified in The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 by the September 2020 deadline. Meanwhile, the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

        Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations 

        1. Navigation of the website using just a keyboard is currently not to the standard required. The focus outline of the currently highlighted link is not clear and the order of links that are selected when pressing the tab key do not follow the order of the items on the page.

        2. The site is not currently employing the HTML5 Speech Recognition API and so is not currently navigable using voice control.

        All of the above items have been logged in our internal issue tracker and will be addressed in a future release.

        Issues with technology?

        The vast majority of our website works correctly on any web technology – we have built this website using open-source software that has given consideration to accessibility as a core requirement of the technical platform, however some of the ways we have implemented and customised this software may alter its accessibility.

        Omeka S Accessibility Statement https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/accessibility/

        For security reasons, we only support TLS 1.2 and higher security protocols; this means that some older Web Browsers will not show the site. For accessibility reasons, web browsers we support do recommend use of JavaScript and where JavaScript is disallowed in the browser, visitors may experience that some of the pages may not work properly.

        How do we test this website?

        IDG Technology for Research, the Warwick Information and Digital Group (IDG) Information Technology (IT) Services team responsible for publishing and maintaining this website test the customisations to these platforms that we make against the web browsers we support and we test our website infrastructure in these browsers as a minimum along with tablets and mobile devices too at the point of design.

        For sites released since September 2019 we have a checklist that includes accessibility before we release a new site or make significant changes. We use the Google Chrome Lighthouse (or Microsoft Edge Developer) tools for web developers and manually test against the accessibility objectives covered in this statement.

        What we are doing to improve accessibility?

        Our first priority is to ensure that accessibility is core to current and future work developed by the IDG Technology for Research team by design, and where we work with academic colleagues who use this website to publish material, giving them tools and guidance on how to do so in an accessible way.

        In addition, through our ongoing commitment to maintaining completed web outputs for past research, we will keep the core open-source software patched and inherit any accessibility improvements made to these underlying platforms. We will also be auditing and testing our older websites to update and make our accessibility statements more informative and where we can reasonably make changes to our systems to make them more accessible, we will plan to make those changes.
