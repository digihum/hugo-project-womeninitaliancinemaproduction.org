        <h5><a href="https://cinetecadibologna.it/">The Cineteca di Bologna</a> is one of Europe’s leading film institutions. Founded in the 1960s as an arm of the municipality of Bologna’s cinema commission, the Cineteca today is comprised of cinemas, archives, a library, film laboratories, publishing activities, and an annual film festival (<a href="https://festival.ilcinemaritrovato.it/">Il cinema Ritrovato</a>). Since it moved to its present premises in 2000, it has become a miniature city of cinema, one of the most innovative and prestigious centres for the preservation, study and promotion of film heritage. Under its director, Gianluca Farinelli, the Cineteca has built an enviable international reputation while developing its local links. It was a partner on Stephen Gundle’s earlier research project on ‘Producers and Production Practices in the History of Italian Cinema, 1949-1976’.</h5>
