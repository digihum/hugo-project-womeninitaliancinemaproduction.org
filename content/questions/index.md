        1. What were the patterns of feminised labour adopted by the Italian film industry in the years 1945-85? 

        We want to investigate the specific pattern assumed by feminisation in an industry in which, after its re-establishment under Mussolini in the 1930s, most roles except for screen performance – including some of those considered ‘women’s work’ elsewhere – were filled by men. The re-ordering of gender roles in the phase of corporate expansion that was occasioned in the US by notions of business efficiency and stability, and in the UK by unionisation, occurred under the supervision of the Fascist state. After 1945, greater feminisation of ostensibly routine roles occurred alongside the breakthrough of some women into higher profile jobs. Throughout this period a central role in recruiting and training industry personnel was played by the national film school, the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia (CSC). With the cooperation secured from the CSC, the project will access archival records on the recruitment and progression over decades of female students and staff, illuminating the school’s role over several decades in contributing to, reinforcing, or undermining, industry gender norms. The producers and distributors’ association ANICA’s extensive archives will be researched from the perspective of gendered labour, paying attention to the economic treatment of different categories of worker and the role of women in the association itself.

        The project has four core objectives: 

        The first objective is one of identification. Research will extend knowledge of women working as screenwriters, assistant directors, editors, production managers, producers, legal officers and set and costume designers. 

        The second objective is to investigate the hierarchical and gendered divisions of labour that governed the film industry, leading to the preclusion of key roles to women and a downplaying of the creative aspects of the spheres in which they were active (set and costume design, editing, dubbing, continuity and secretarial roles). 

        The third objective is to challenge the way the industry’s history has been written by valorising the personal papers of Mara Blasetti (one of the first female production managers), Cecilia Mangini (a pioneer director of documentaries who was always critical of the industry), and the screenwriter Suso Cecchi D’Amico and her daughters (both of whom later achieved prominence in state media institutions) – all of which will be catalogued and digitised in association with the Cineteca di Bologna. This will be complemented by oral histories of both past and present female film professionals.

        The fourth objective is to interpret the place of women in the industry adapting the insights of international research and those deriving from the methodologies adapted to the Italian case. In publications, documentary films, a photographic exhibition and other outputs, the team will elaborate on project archival work and interviews to highlight the varied nature of the obstacles women faced and the ways in which their labour was often configured as of a service nature and limited to supporting functions. It will shed light on the ways they used family, female sociability and soft skills to make careers for themselves even if proper acknowledgement and rewards were lacking. The project will interrogate the industry’s normative self-images, its understandings of creativity, its divisions of labour and will seek to understand whether there was greater flexibility in medium and small enterprises and in the less prestigious branches of the industry.
