        <h6>Use of Cookies</h6?
        <b>1. What is a cookie?</b>

        Most web sites use cookies to remember information about you and your preferences, either for the duration of your visit or for repeat visits. A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a web site, and that web site can then retrieve the contents of that cookie. 

        If we didn't use cookies, our web site would think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, if you were to enter your login details and then move to another page, our site wouldn't be able to remember that you'd previously signed in. 

        Cookies may be set by the web site you are visiting ('first party cookies') or by other web sites which provide content on the page you are viewing ('third party cookies').   

        <b>2. What cookies does this web site use?</b>

        <b>Cookie Duration</b>
