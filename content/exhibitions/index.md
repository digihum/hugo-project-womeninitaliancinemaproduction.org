        A photographic exhibition of women of the film industry over the period 1940s â€“ 1980s will be held at Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival in Bologna. The material will consist of images discovered in the course of archival research, obtained through institutional collaboration and borrowed from interviewees.
The exhibition will also be staged by CinemaItalia UK in London and then integrated into the digital archive.
