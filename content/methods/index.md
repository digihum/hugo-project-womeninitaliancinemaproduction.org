        The project will blend conventional historical methods of archival research and research on the press, whose value has been underlined by the new film history and new cinema history, with techniques developed within production studies and family history. It will adopt oral history to capture experiences that have remained largely or completely undocumented.

        Data collection: Archival material
        The project will work in partnership with the Cineteca di Bologna. The Cineteca holds the extensive personal archives of the directors Alessandro Blasetti and Vittorio De Sica, as well as the archive of the producer Franco Cristaldi. These will all be searched and interrogated with a view to highlighting gendered labour and overlooked professional stories. The Cineteca also hosts the archives of the production manager and assistant director Mara Blasetti, and of documentary maker Cecilia Mangini. The two archives are of critical importance in re-framing understandings of the place of women. Strategies will be developed for reading them in a new way and making them accessible through critically informed cataloguing and digitisation. These interventions will be shaped by the consultation of eighteen other women’s archives that have been identified including those of producers, production managers, casting directors, script supervisors, and lawyers.
Moreover, the project will consult and selectively digitise the papers of Suso Cecchi d’Amico (the leading screenwriter in Italy in 1950s and 1960s) and her daughters Caterina D’Amico (producer, educator, and former head of CSC) and Silvia D’Amico Bendicò (agent, screenwriter, and producer).
